\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this work, we summarize Ivan Ukhov's education and career, as well as other
aspects related to Ivan's personal and professional work. The motivation is to
make it easier for potential employers to quickly obtain a sufficiently
comprehensive understanding of Ivan's profile and subsequently decide if and how
to proceed with the talent-acquisition process.

\section{Introduction}

\lettrine[findent=0.4em, nindent=0em]{\textbf{T}}{alent acquisition} becomes
increasingly more difficult, especially in the field of information technology.
There are very many candidates, and they possess very diverse and nuanced
skills, making it challenging to navigate. Under these circumstances, it is
important to be able to make a reasonably accurate estimation if the candidate
in question would be a good fit for the job at hand. Ivan Ukhov is one such
candidate, and this paper presents his profile so as to streamline the
aforementioned estimation process.\footfloat{\linkmarker The omega subscript
indicates the presence of interactive content. It is not accessible in print
form; however, it is considered optional.}

The subsequent sections go over a number of areas in the order of decreasing
importance. \sref{professional-interests} and \ref{section:technical-skills}
describe Ivan’s professional interests and technical skills, respectively, which
are arguably the ones dictating the drive and the ability to follow through.
\sref{work-experience}, \ref{section:teaching-experience}, and
\ref{section:learning-experience} present Ivan's experience in terms of working,
teaching, and learning, respectively. In \sref{academic-qualifications}, Ivan's
formal education is summarized. \sref{publications} and \ref{section:projects}
list selected scientific publications and open-source projects, respectively. In
\sref{personal-information}, Ivan's personal information is given. Lastly,
\sref{conclusion} concludes the paper.

\section{Professional Interests} \slab{professional-interests}

We begin Ivan's professional interests. They are centered on decision-making
based on collected evidence combined with prior domain knowledge, answering
business questions via inferential and predictive modeling, optimization of
business processes by means of learning from data, and development of data
products. The underlying disciplines are data science, machine learning,
software engineering, and statistics.

\section{Technical Skills} \slab{technical-skills}

There are a number of methodologies and technologies Ivan has come across and
acquired through out his education and career: strong knowledge of Python and R,
including their ecosystems; strong knowledge of SQL; strong knowledge of
TensorFlow; strong knowledge of Google Cloud Platform; strong knowledge of shell
scripting, Go, and Rust; good knowledge of Airflow, Docker, and Kubeflow; good
knowledge of software testing; familiarity with C++, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS;
good knowledge of continuous integration and deployment; proficiency in version
control with Git; and proficiency in Vim and LaTeX.
